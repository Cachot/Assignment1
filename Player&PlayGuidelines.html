Volleyball is a sport that is safe, fun and does  not require extreme fitness. Since you don&rsquo;t have to move around the court too fast,  it&rsquo;s great for people who want a low-impact sport that will help them get fit  without pushing them to their limit. For those who are a bit more competitive,  the sport is fantastic because games can be really exciting and intense, but  there&rsquo;s always a net between you and your opponents. </p>
